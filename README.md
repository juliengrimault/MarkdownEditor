Markdown text editor
--------------------

This is a very simple markdown text editor that I created to learn about TextKit. It currently implements only basic tags like **bold**, *italic*, _underline_. I plan on adding support for more 'complex' tags such as link and picture soon.

Feel free to use it if you like it.
